    <string name="help_gen_qtn1">What is VURVhealth?</string>
    <string name="help_gen_qtn1A">"VURVhealth is a new way for all Americans to save on their out-of-pocket medical costs. Our nationwide database of quality physicians, facilities, and health specialists provides access to low, pre-negotiated cash prices on thousands of health and wellness treatments and services.

We are the cure for high out-of-pocket medical costs. No matter if you're insured, uninsured, or something in between you may be paying too much for the care you need. VURVhealth helps make health and wellness accessible, affordable, and hassle-free where traditional insurance falls short."</string>
    <string name="help_gen_qtn2">How does VUVRhealth save me money?</string>
    <string name="help_gen_qtn2A">"Most health care providers offer discounted cash prices to patients who pay cash upfront (or \"out-of-pocket\") instead of using insurance. VURVhealth negotiates on behalf of our members to lock in EVEN MORE SAVINGS off the cash rate.

Think of your VURVhealth membership like a coupon that you apply at checkout. When you visit a doctor or facility from our nationwide database, you'll save instantly with the lowest possible out-of-pocket rate. There's no paperwork, hassles, or waiting to be reimbursed."</string>
    <string name="help_gen_qtn3">Who can save money with VURVhealth?</string>
    <string name="help_gen_qtn31">"When you're not insured."</string>
    <string name="help_gen_qtn32">"When your current insurance doesn't cover the care you need."</string>
    <string name="help_gen_qtn33">"When you're not meeting a high insurance deductible."</string>
    <string name="help_gen_qtn3A">Anyone stuck paying out-of-pocket for their health care can use VURVhealth. Here are a few common cases where VURVhealth can help you save time and money:</string>
    <string name="help_gen_qtn4">Is VURVhealth insurance?</string>
    <string name="help_gen_qtn41">"No. VURV is an affordable solution to high out-of-pocket costs that are common with or without traditional insurance. Our plans provide you with savings on a wide range of health care and wellness services, and you'll get these discounts when you pay out-of-pocket with the provider instead of using insurance."</string>
    <string name="help_gen_qtn42">I already have insurance. Why do I need a VURVhealth membership?</string>
    <string name="help_gen_qtn4A">"There are many common insurance cases where a VURVhealth membership could save you money.

Many insurance plans do not include vision or dental. Perhaps you are stuck paying thousands of dollars toward a deductible that you'll never meet. Or you just have the minimum insurance plan (aka \"catastrophic insurance\") that only covers the big stuff. Maybe you'd like to upgrade your insurance to cover more services, but the cost of doing so is ridiculously high.

If you're insured, but still paying out-of-pocket for the care you need, VURVhealth offers a hassle-free solution at an affordable price."</string>
    <string name="help_gen_qtn5">Will paying for health care with my VURVhealth membership count towards my deductible?</string>
    <string name="help_gen_qtn5A">"You will need to contact your insurance provider to confirm whether purchases through VURVhealth count toward your deductible. In most cases, the answer will be no.

VURVhealth operates outside of any health insurance coverage you may have. Dealing with insurance reimbursements is a costly hassle for health care providers, so doctors and facilities offer discounts to patients who simply pay cash. VURVhealth maximizes those discounted rates for their members upfront without the hassle of forms or reimbursements."</string>
    <string name="help_gen_qtn6">What about the rest of my family?</string>
    <string name="help_gen_qtn6A">"Your free VURVRx plan saves on prescriptions for the whole family. Even pets. Showing your Card at the pharmacy check-out will save you instantly, regardless of who the prescription is for.

You can add a family member to an already existing VURVhealth Family Discount Plan."</string>
    <string name="help_gen_qtn7">How does VURVhealth make money?</string>
    <string name="help_gen_qtn7A">"VURVhealth is a subscription service that helps you find quality, affordable options when you're paying out-of-pocket for health care. We offer access to our nationwide database of discounted providers in return for a monthly or annual fee.

That's it. We do not sell your information, and we do not make a commission from referrals or your individual treatments."</string>
    <string name="help_gen_qtn8">Is my information kept private?</string>
    <string name="help_gen_qtn8A">Absolutely. Your trust is our top priority. VURVhealth will never sell or distribute any of your information. We help connect you to great, affordable health care providers, but your treatments and services are confidential between you and your provider.</string>
    <string name="help_m_txt">What is VURVhealth Medical Services?</string>
    <string name="help_m_txt1A">All VURVhealth plan members subscribed to the Pulse Discount Plan.</string>
    <string name="help_m_txt2">How do I schedule an appointment with a VURVhealth medical doctor or service?</string>
    <string name="help_m_txt21">"Call the phone number associated with the doctor or facility within our directory to directly schedule an appointment. Because we continually update our database of providers, please call the doctor's office within 24 hours of your appointment to confirm their participation in the VURVhealth ValuePoint program by MultiPlan."</string>
    <string name="help_m_txt3">"How will the doctor's office know that I am part of VURVhealth?"</string>
    <string name="help_m_txt31">Upon arriving at your appointment, present your VURVhealth ID Card directly from the mobile app which features the ValuePoint by MultiPlan logo and member expiration date. You will not be able to participate in the discounted rates if you cannot show your valid VURVhealth ID Card and expiration date.</string>
    <string name="help_m_txt4">How do I know how much I owe for my medical office visit?</string>
    <string name="help_m_txt41">As an eligible VURVhealth ID Card holder, your discounts are offered only in exchange for payment in full at the time of medical service, or per a payment agreement between you and the medical provider.</string>
    <string name="help_m_txt5">"There is a provider listed in your network, but when I called to schedule an appointment I was told this provider doesn't participate with you."</string>
    <string name="help_m_txt51">"Although we update our database of providers daily, it's possible that providers drop out of the network or that personnel at the provider's office are unaware of their participation in the VURVhealth ValuePoint by MultiPlan program. If the provider indicates that they do not participate, please contact ValuePoint by MultiPlan directly at (866) 750-7427 to bring the matter to our attention. This telephone number is also listed on your VURVhealth ID Medical Card."</string>
    <string name="help_m_txt6">How do I make arrangements for admission into a medical facility?</string>
    <string name="help_m_txt61">For non-emergency services, select your facility from our database and call the admissions office directly to make an appointment and have your questions answered. The facility will require your VURVhealth ID Card information to verify eligibility in the ValuePoint by MultiPlan program over the phone or when you arrive at the facility.</string>
    <string name="help_m_txtA">"VURVhealth has partnered with ValuePoint by MultiPlan to give members access to medical providers that offer discounts to reduce the balance they owe the provider at the point of service so they'll know exactly how much they need to pay. This payment is to be made either in full, or per an agreed upon payment arrangement between the member and the medical provider."</string>
    <string name="help_pkg_qtn1">How do I use my membership?</string>
    <string name="help_pkg_qtn1A">"First, use our convenient app or website to search for the closest providers of the type of health care you need.

Then, when you find the doctor or facility you like, simply use the phone number provided to schedule an appointment with the provider directly. Have your VURVhealth ID ready in case they need it. It's also a good idea to confirm your appointment the day before and double-check that they're still accepting VURVhealth plans.

Finally, on the day of your appointment, present your valid VURVhealth ID Card upon arrival so they know to offer you the special cash rates we've negotiated with them at checkout."</string>
    <string name="help_pkg_qtn2">I just upgraded, when can I use my new VURVhealth plan?</string>
    <string name="help_pkg_qtn2A">"Right away! Once you've chosen a plan, you're eligible to save immediately. Simply find a provider in our database and schedule an appointment."</string>
    <string name="help_pkg_qtn3">Where can I use my VURVhealth ID Card?</string>
    <string name="help_pkg_qtn3A">Our searchable database is constantly updated to keep you informed of the affordable health care options in your area. These options will vary based on your membership level. You can view the database on the VURVhealth app or on the web by clicking here.</string>
    <string name="help_pkg_qtn4">How do I know how much I will spend and save using my membership?</string>
    <string name="help_pkg_qtn4A">"This will vary with every appointment, but know that using VURVhealth means you're getting the best discount on a provider's out-of-pocket rate.

Your provider should be able to quote you on the cost of your visit before you arrive. However, this price won't include any additional treatments or services that may occur during your visit. When you're paying out-of-pocket, it's always a good idea to ask your provider about additional costs before agreeing to treatment to avoid surprises."</string>
    <string name="help_pkg_qtn5">I already have a provider I love, can I use VURVhealth with them?</string>
    <string name="help_pkg_qtn5A">"If they're in our database, yes! However, your VURVhealth Card will not work with providers that aren't included in the database."</string>
    <string name="help_pkg_qtn6">"What if a provider from the database doesn't recognize VURVhealth or my VURVhealth ID?"</string>
    <string name="help_pkg_qtn6A">"Not to worry, it's possible the staff isn't familiar with VURVhealth. In this case, they can call 866-750-7427 with questions or for help. This number is also printed on your VURVhealth ID.

It's also possible this provider has dropped out of our network and the database hasn't updated yet. We're constantly updating our database to ensure you're best informed of your health care options."</string>
    <string name="help_pkg_qtn7">"I'm shopping around and getting quotes, why are costs different between providers?"</string>
    <string name="help_pkg_qtn7A">"One provider may bill the same procedure differently than another, which can lead to price differences. It's not a bad idea to call ahead and get real numbers over the phone so you know what to expect when you pay for your visit.

Regardless, using VURVhealth will ensure you are getting a provider's lowest price."</string>
    <string name="help_pkg_qtn8">Is there any additional paperwork or forms to fill out?</string>
    <string name="help_pkg_qtn8A">"Nope. Once you've created an account with us and signed up for a VURVhealth plan, you're done filling out paperwork."</string>
    <string name="help_pp_txt11">How do I find the VURVhealth discount price on my medication?</string>
    <string name="help_pp_txt111">Search our prescription database by inputting your medication and location. Your VURVhealth discount price will be listed with each matching pharmacy.</string>
    <string name="help_pp_txt12">Why are prices different between pharmacies?</string>
    <string name="help_pp_txt121">"Prices differ from city to city, and even pharmacy to pharmacy, based on the different deals pharmacies make with drug companies, which affect their pricing formulas and this changes constantly. It's always a good idea to check your prescription against the VURVhealth database before filling and refilling."</string>
    <string name="help_pp_txt13">Can I use VURVRx to save on over-the-counter medications?</string>
    <string name="help_pp_txt131">Yes, your VURVRx Card can also be used for over-the-counter medications written on a valid prescription pad with the appropriate GCN/NDC numbers associated with them, and on pet prescription medications purchased at a pharmacy.</string>
    <string name="help_pp_txt14">Does my Card expire?</string>
    <string name="help_pp_txt141">No! Your VURVRx Card does not expire.</string>
    <string name="help_pp_txt15">Are there limits to how often I can use my Card?</string>
    <string name="help_pp_txt151">No! Your VURVRx Card has unlimited usage, save with it as often as you like.</string>
    <string name="help_pp_txt16">"What if my pharmacist isn't familiar with VURVRx?"</string>
    <string name="help_pp_txt161">"Don't panic. Some pharmacists aren't aware of the contracts their pharmacies have with us. They should process the Card like any normal insurance card, but if they have questions we have a support team ready 24/7 to help at (866) 921-7286. You can also reach out to us directly through our Contact Us page or at support@VURVhealth.com."</string>
    <string name="help_pp_txt17">What do I do if I have prescription coverage with my health insurance?</string>
    <string name="help_pp_txt171">The VURVhealth Rx Card can still help those with insurance. Have the pharmacist use the VURVhealth Rx Card instead of your insurance to see if the cost is lower. Oftentimes, our prices on certain prescriptions and brand name drugs are lower than insurance co-pays. See for yourself!</string>
    <string name="help_pp_txt18">Does the VURVhealth Rx Card count towards my insurance deductible?</string>
    <string name="help_pp_txt181">The VURVhealth Rx Card program will SOMETIMES count towards a deductible. As not all medical insurance plans are the same, we recommend users to contact their plan administrator to get the specific information regarding their medical insurance plan.</string>
    <string name="help_pp_txt19">Can the VURVhealth Rx Card help Medicare users?</string>
    <string name="help_pp_txt191">Although the VURVhealth Rx Card discount can be used as a Medicare Part D supplement by covering drugs once participants reach the \"donut hole,\" drugs purchased with this discount program will not count toward your Medicare deductible and therefore will not allow you to exceed your deductible and get out of the \"donut hole. \" We suggest you contact your plan administrator to get the specifics, because not all plans are the same.</string>
    <string name="help_pp_txt3">THIS IS NOT INSURANCE</string>
    <string name="help_pp_txt4">"This program is a prescription drug coupon. 
This Card cannot be used in combination with any third-party payer program, including but not limited to Medicare and Medicaid."</string>
